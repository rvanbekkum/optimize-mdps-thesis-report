\textbf{\textcolor{tudblue}{Conclusions:}}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Handcrafting MDPs for systems with uncertain dynamics is a daunting task, which can be eased through learning algorithms
	\item Evaluating all hyperparameter settings is a cost-expensive endeavor; using BO one may determine more effectively which settings maximize performance
	\item Applying BO first with a performance measure that abstracts more from the real world, can aid in steering BO to the hyperparameters that maximize performance in simulations
\end{itemize}
