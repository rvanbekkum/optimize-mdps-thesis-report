\chapter*{Preface}
\setheader{Preface}

% The thesis report contains a preface that explains the topic of the thesis, the context (institute or company), the main findings in a few lines and the names of the members of the thesis committee. The preface may end with a few acknowledgments, and completed with name and date.

In the last year of my master studies, I have had the opportunity to explore and gain insight into fields of research including planning, reinforcement learning and optimization that I was not familiar with at the start of this project.
This report documents the work on identifying the possibilities of automating the task of learning performance-maximizing Markov Decision Processes from data effectively, performed as a master thesis project in the Algorithmics Group of the Department of Software Technology of the EEMCS Faculty at the Delft University of Technology.

I would like to thank Bruno Lacerda, University of Birmingham, for the tips I got at the start of the project on the usage of the robot simulation software.
Especially, I would like to thank Matthijs Spaan for being my supervisor during this project in which the weekly meetings in which we could exchange ideas were very helpful.
