\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{ch:conclusions}

The goal of this thesis is to provide a foundation for an algorithmic technique for learning \acrfullpl{acr:mdp} for planning under uncertainty which maximize yielded performance given a dataset describing the dynamics of the system under consideration.
This chapter presents a summary of the presented work and the contributions made in \autoref{sec:summary} and revisits the identified research questions in \autoref{sec:revisiting-research-questions}.
Finally, this chapter concludes this thesis with recommendations and suggestions for future work in \autoref{sec:recommendations-future-work} and our concluding remarks in \autoref{sec:concluding-remarks}.
